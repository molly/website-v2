  .intro
    p
      | On March 20, 2022, the <i>New York Times</i> published a 14,000-word puff piece on cryptocurrencies, both 
      | online and as an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220401215134/https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1505582695287468036">entire section of the Sunday print edition</a>. Though 
      | its author, Kevin Roose, wrote that it aimed to be a "sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually
      | <i>is</i>", it was a thinly-veiled advertisement for cryptocurrency that appeared to have received little
      | in the way of fact-checking or critical editorial scrutiny. It uncritically repeated many questionable or 
      | entirely fallacious arguments from cryptocurrency advocates, and it appears that no experts on the topic
      | were consulted, or even anyone with a less-than-rosy view on crypto. This is grossly irresponsible.
    p Here, a group of around <a href="#contributors">fifteen cryptocurrency researchers and critics</a> have done what the <i>New York Times</i> apparently won't.

          | Crypto skeptic Ben McKenzie has argued that this is a sign that the bubble has become precariously large, not that crypto has become ubiquitous: "The celebrities are a symptom of a much bigger problem… You've got all this money and you're trying to get it out to more people and get more people to buy. And if one were to compare cryptocurrency to, say, an MLM or a ponzi, then you would need ever more people to come in to keep the thing going. Celebrities are sort of the natural endpoint for that. At its biggest, you need the biggest: you need Matt Damon and Larry David and sports stars to sell it." (<a href="https://youtu.be/AijwGyNLtjc?t=865"><i>Crypto Critics' Corner</i>, episode 51</a>)

            | As David Gerard wrote in his 2017 book <i>Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain</i>, "Cryptocurrency advocates and lazy journalists like to talk about the 'market cap' of crypto, which is the total number of coins or tokens in existence multiplied by today's price. This is a bogus number that's not actually applicable to anything — it's not money that was put into the crypto, it's not a realisable value like a company market cap, it doesn't affect prices — it's just an easily-calculated number that sounds good in a headline. Trading is so thin in any crypto, even Bitcoin, that you could never realise a fraction of the number."

        | As it’s gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse. Its biggest fans think it’s saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it’s all a scam — an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.

          p This is a statement desperately in need of some links. Although Roose has linked to his own writing quite liberally throughout this article, it certainly doesn't show "extreme skepticism", nor for that matter does his optimism seem particularly cautious. This article notably doesn't seem to link to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html">August 2021 <i>Times</i> article about the "Pudgy Penguins" NFT project</a>, which served to lend the project legitimacy and pump the price before the group later attempted to scam a prospective buyer of the company. No follow-up was ever published—this is a recurring theme for the articles Roose writes about various crypto projects, as you will see throughout this commentary.
          p Roose has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220219172535/https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1495085866192027655">publicly advocated</a> for journalists who write about crypto to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and NFTs, despite himself acknowledging the "strong biasing effect" it would have and that the traditional finance equivalent of this behavior is prohibited by most reputable publications. He holds the <code>cryptoroose.eth</code> <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/ethereum-name-service-ens-explained-guide-learn">ENS domain</a> (which he <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdd58208d954f61ed181899d4380266246eb483c8e0cb6bf2d471cc4fb64708e1">bought</a> in October for $21… plus another $136 in transaction fees). He uses the associated wallet for transactions relating to his reporting, including the $500,000 sale of an NFT representing a <i>Times</i> article that he mentions in this piece, the receipt of some Pudgy Penguins NFTs from the creator of the project (later returned), and similar.

              li There are on-chain obfuscation technologies like Tornado Cash and Samurai

            p Notwithstanding that, yes, competent criminals can absolutely use crypto for illicit activity—isn't the flip side of this argument that blockchain ledgers are fundamentally privacy-less? If the argument is that it's easy to track criminals through crypto ledgers, then it would be easy to track anyone through them. Especially the average person, who doesn't know how to obfuscate their activity.
            p In what universe is it a good idea for everyone's financial transactions to be publicly available (especially to, as this very sentence implies, to law enforcement)? "Debunking" this anti-crypto argument only forms a stronger, much more critical one.

        p Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my explanations, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous. That’s OK. My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you.

          .commenter Neil Turkewitz
          p While I appreciate Kevin’s attempt to “explain” crypto to the masses, his very introduction is problematic. Why would understanding crypto be of particular importance for the “naturally skeptical?” Wouldn’t it make more sense to posit that understanding crypto was of greater immediate importance to those likely to invest money that perhaps they couldn’t afford to lose? Isn’t it more likely that the “naturally skeptical” are probably more familiar with how crypto works than the “naturally embracing” given the amount of pro-crypto propaganda to which we are constantly bombarded? And even the use of the term “naturally” is itself intriguing and telling—suggesting that skepticism is likely to stem from a certain form of romantic and emotional uniformed resistance to change a la Larry David rather than from the application of reason and the too-rare employment of critical thinking.
          p To fully explain crypto to the masses, one might be forgiven for thinking that priority number one should be to carefully and fully describe the manifest financial risks, and to explain to the innocent how crypto is anchored in, and supports, a vision of society in which public institutions and functions are replaced by private parties. And how that vision naturally aligns with, and advances, a political agenda that undermines progressive ideas of society and government, regardless of one’s personal views of how it might be employed to advance a particular noble or progressive cause. Kevin wants us to know that not every person that invests in crypto does so out of pure selfishness, or to support regressive frameworks of governance. That is undoubtedly true, but it entirely misses the point.

Dogecoin is currently priced at around $0.12 and the "Dogecoin millionaire" is back to being a hundred-thousand-aire who serves to inspire others to make enormously risky decisions and hold their positions beyond all reason.

Some of the wealthy (e.g. some of the folks behind exchanges like Binance and Kraken) parrot true believer talking points, but I suspect those are not so much strongly-held convictions as they are convenient ways to launder their work as ideological rather than money-driven.

            | No one in "the early 2010s" argued that social media would just go away. The prototypes of social media were already over a decade old, and the core product, micro-updates, chat functionality, and asynchronous communication, was already a deeply well proven feature for a decade before that via message boards, IRC, ICQ, and MSN messenger. The arguments revolved mostly around specific companies surviving the churn cycle of the 00s, but "will Facebook be the next Friendster?" isn't as useful for painting these un-cited critics as dinosaurs who just didn't get it.

(Where it's referring to anyone in specific at all, that is.) But which of those groups are supposed to have the power to "steer" anything?
            p Or to quote <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/can-the-media-stop-crypto">Max Read</a> on this one: "I'm also increasingly less convinced that a 'better' tech journalism, by any definition of the word, would have made a particular difference in how the internet of the 21st century has unfolded so far. What strikes me looking back at tech journalism of the 2000s is how fast Facebook (to take the most prominent example) was growing: zero to 500 million users in just five years. I'm not sure any analysis or criticism, no matter how damning, could have slowed that kind of planetary momentum — and there was plenty of good analysis and criticism of Facebook at the time. What was missing was a coherent, organized, well-resourced political movement that could have matched Facebook's size, speed, and capital."

        h4 Let’s start from the beginning: What is crypto?
        p A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. But in recent years, it’s been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, “crypto” usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains — the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like <mark aria-details="nfts-web3">NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.</mark>

          | It's really bizarre that Roose describes this as a no-nonsense explainer for people trying to figure out what on earth all this crypto stuff even is, but then also uses all this jargon like "NFTs", "web3", and "DeFi" in this long introductory section without describing what any of these terms mean until much, much later. It seems like he can't find his audience.

        h4 Ah yes, blockchains. Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?
        p At a very basic level, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/blockchains-guide-information.html">blockchains</a> are shared databases that store and <mark aria-details="verify">verify</mark> information in a cryptographically secure way.

          | "Validation/verification" has a specific computer science meaning and like many of these things they don't tend to translate well into everyday jargon. Using this term in this way is likely to mislead the average reader, who would likely interpret this to mean that there is some verification of the <i>accuracy</i> of any information that is added to a blockchain. The verification that I believe he is intending to describe is other nodes verifying that some data exists on the chain, not verifying that the data is any good, and he should be much more explicit about that.

            | Nothing says giving artists control over their economic destinies like creating a system where art theft is rampant and painfully difficult for artists to combat. How is he not touching on the art theft and exploitation of creators at all??

            p While this is far from the most dangerous part of Kevin’s formulation of the “truth of crypto,” it is the one that strikes closest to home for me personally. Decentralization as a theoretical tool for empowering artists has been a feature of the advocacy landscape since the arrival of Napster in 1999. It has proven to be both illusory and wildly exploitative. The tools for decentralization—for bypassing gatekeepers, have existed for more than two decades. There is nothing new about crypto to aid in this putative empowerment. The problem that artists confront is that the asset which they create/own has virtually no value given decades of a dominant idea, peddled by many of the same advocates for web3/crypto, that “information wants to be free.” But capacity to individually create and distribute is not synonymous with empowerment when it fails to produce revenue that sustains creators. And don’t get me started on NFTs. NFTs solve none of these problems. Basically, they’re like telling artists—your music isn’t worth anything, but perhaps you can monetize this unique digital collectible. The NFT is a gimmick, not an asset.
            p Now it’s all fine and good for Kevin to say that “some proponents will say” that decentralization will empower artists. That’s a true statement. Some people will say that Trump was the greatest president in US history. That is also a true statement of the views of “some people.” But it is beyond irresponsible to fail to interrogate this claim, and the lessons of history in demonstrating its failures.

          p It is and always has been possible to do this since the internet started. Artists take commissions and exchange digital assets all the time. Artists design tattoos, musicians create soundtracks, 3D modelers build assets, etc. There is absolutely nothing stopping an artist from setting up a website where they charge $250 to draw a custom picture of a rabbit or whatever.
          p Artists (to a certain extent) <i>want</i> those "gatekeepers" because they are platforms that bring in an audience or automate some complicated task like inventory management or product hosting. But if you really want to cut out the middleman, it's more than possible. For example, <i>MST3K</i> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mystery-science-theater-3000-mst3k-season-13-trailer-date-movies-cast-how-to-watch">just announced</a> their own streaming platform just to host their newest season.
          p How is this not selling "directly to fans"?

            p One of the best traits of a good tech reporter is someone who is able to evaluate something in terms of a regular person and translate a complex topic into simple terms. Kevin is actually good at this — he really is — and I'm disappointed that this is not on its own a huge deal. 
            p It takes literally seconds from me grabbing my phone from my pocket to send $5 on Square Cash, with maybe 3 actual "buttons" (and bits can be done via Face ID) — that is the speed of the actual work I have to do, and the transaction, again, takes seconds.
            p In the case of a crypto transaction, it's incredibly important to add that "sending money" can mean a lot of things, and that you are "sending" it and have to pay to send it, and then once it's sent, it has to be recorded and depending on how they <i>received</i> it may take more confirmations before you can actually receive the money.
            p The comparison here is different because the experience of <i>using</i> money is different. When I receive $5 from Square Cash, I can get that in my bank in a second using the same refund mechanism that Coinbase uses. If someone sends me $5 of Eth on Coinbase, I need to wait for confirmations.
            p It's just so much more wonky than he's making it seem.
